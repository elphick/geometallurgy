<p>This example adds a second dimension.  The second dimension is an interval, of the form interval_from, interval_to.
It is also known as binned data, where each ‘bin’ is bounded between and upper and lower limit.</p>
<p>An interval is relevant in geology, when analysing drill hole data.</p>
<p>Intervals are also encountered in metallurgy, but in that discipline they are often called fractions,
e.g. size fractions.  In that case the typical nomenclature is size_retained, size passing, since the data
originates from a sieve stack.</p>
