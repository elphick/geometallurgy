Flowsheets
==========

In the real world, a process flowsheet consists of process streams connected to unit operations.
A `Flowsheet` object represents the same, with a `Stream` object representing the mass-composition flow
and an `Operation` represents the unit-operations (or feed, stockpiles, outputs).
