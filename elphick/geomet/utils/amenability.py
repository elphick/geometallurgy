    Implementation of the Amenability Index as presented in the paper titled APPLICATIONS OF INDIVIDUAL PARTICLE
    PYKNOMETRY by G. Elphick and Dr. T.F. Mason at the DMS POWDERSâ€™ 10th FERROSILICON CONFERENCE.

    The amenability Index for a particular gangue analyte is the complement of the relative recovery to the target
     analyte across the full sample.  It is process / operating point independent, hence characterises the ore,
     not the process.

    Args:
        df_recovery: DataFrame containing the ideal incremental recovery of a fractionated sample.
        col_target: The column name of the target analyte
        col_mass_recovery: The column name of the mass_recovery (yield) column

    Returns:
        A pd.Series containing the Amenability Indices for the gangue analytes
